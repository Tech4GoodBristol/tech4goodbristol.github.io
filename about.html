                    Tech4Good Bristol is a meetup group providing free cross-sector peer support to help not-for-profits increase their digital and data literacy.</p>

<p>Tech4Good Bristol is a volunteer-run, non-funded meet-up group set up with the purpose of providing support for not-for-profit 
  and charitable organisations. As part of the NetSquared community, TechSoup sponsor the costs of hosting the meetup details on meetup.com, 
  and KETL have been covering the costs of a few drinks and nibbles at the events.
</p>

<p>Our meetups usually take the form of short presentations followed by questions and answers, or more indepth workshops to teach skills. 
At every meetup we also host a "community shout outs" section, where any attendee can tell the rest of the group about an event or interesting digital offering, 
or request help from the rest of the group with a particular problem they are facing.</p>
