                 Tech4Good Bristol is completely non-funded and is run by a small group of volunteers to set up meet-up events that are focused on bringing tech expertise and know-how to the not-for-profit sector so that we can work together for the social good.
                </p>
<p>
If you are able to help out in some way, we'd love to hear from you! Some areas where help would be useful include:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>Ideas for future meet-up topics</li>
  <li>Help with the administration of the group</li>
  <li>Help at events to sign people in at the door and generally help out at particular events</li>
  <li>Authoring of guest posts on the blog</li>
  </ul>

<p>If you are able to volunteer yourself for any of these things or have an idea about how else you can help, please fill out our form:</p>
